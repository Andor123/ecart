# Simple E-commerce Shopping Cart
This project includes a simple E-commerce shopping cart

## Quick summary
For this project the following models where used:
– User: For the authentication of the order
– Product: Where the products are listed
– Cart: This is where the ordered item gets before payment
– CartItem: The data for the product in the cart
– Order: All the important information about the whole order
– OrderItem: The data for the product that ended up in the order

When a user decide on what to purchase, first it goes into the cart after clicking the "Add to Cart" button, then within the cart, the user can decide on increasing the amount of the ordered item, remove it, or send it to check out.

There is also a feature where the site's admin gets two emails. The first one is about information of an item, that has a low number at the stock. The second one is a daily sales report, talking about all the items they sold the previous day.
